# Iris Streamlit ML App ðŸŒ¸
This project is a Streamlit web application that uses a trained Random Forest Classifier to predict iris flower species. I have provided the link of the live web app below.

## Overview
- This project is a web application built using Streamlit.
- Deploys a machine learning model trained on the Iris dataset.
- Allows users to input measurements of iris flowers:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width
- Provides predictions about the species:
  - Setosa
  - Versicolor
  - Virginica
- Includes visualizations to enhance understanding:
  - Prediction probabilities
  - Feature importance

- `ml.py`: Trains and saves the model as `model.pkl`
- `app.py`: Streamlit app to load model and make predictions
- `model.pkl`: Pre-trained model file
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies
-
